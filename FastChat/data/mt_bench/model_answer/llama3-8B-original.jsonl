The Starry Night by Vincent van Gogh: Create a virtual reality experience where children can explore the night sky and see the stars from the perspective of the artist. Include information about the painting and the artist's inspiration behind it.\n2. The Persistence of Memory by Salvador Dali: Create a game where children can explore a surreal landscape inspired by the painting. Incorporate elements like melting clocks, ants, and a dream-like atmosphere.\n3. The Scream by Edvard Munch: Create a virtual reality experience where children can feel the emotions of the painting by walking through a dark and eerie forest. Include information about the artist's inspiration behind the painting.\n4. The Great Wave off Kanagawa by Katsushika Hokusai: Create a virtual reality experience where children can explore the ocean and see the waves from the perspective of the artist. Incorporate information about the painting and the artist's inspiration behind it.\n5. The Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci: Create a virtual reality experience where children can explore the painting and see it from different angles. Include information about the painting and the artist's inspiration behind it.\nRemember to tailor the experience to the child's age and interests, and make sure to include educational elements to help them learn about art and the artist's inspiration.", "Here is a concrete plan for adapting The Starry Night by Vincent van Gogh into an interactive experience for children:\n1. Virtual Reality Experience: Create a virtual reality experience where children can explore the night sky and see the stars from the perspective of the artist. The experience should be designed to be accessible and engaging for children, with clear instructions and guidance.\n2. Educational Elements: Incorporate educational elements into the experience, such as information about the painting and the artist's inspiration behind it. This can be done through audio narration, text, or interactive elements.\n3. Budget Estimates: The budget for this project would include the cost of developing the virtual reality experience, which can range from $10,000 to $50,000 depending on the complexity of the experience and the platform used. Additionally, there may be costs associated with promoting and distributing the experience.\nRemember to consider the budget and resources available when planning this project, and to work with experts in the field of virtual reality and educational technology to ensure the best possible outcome."]}], "tstamp": 1734396972.5314407}

To solve this inequality, we first need to rewrite it in the form of an absolute value equation. This can be done by squaring both sides of the inequality and simplifying the resulting expression. We get |x + 5|2 < 102. Now, we can apply the square root property to both sides of the inequality to obtain |x + 5| < 10. The solution to this inequality is a set of integers that lie within the range of -5 and 5, since the absolute value of any integer within this range is less than 10. Therefore, the solution to the inequality |x + 5| < 10 is the set of integers {-5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4}.
